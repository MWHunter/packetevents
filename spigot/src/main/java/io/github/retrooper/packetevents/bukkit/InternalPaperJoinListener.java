/**
 * We need to save the player instance before the first play-phase packets get sent by the server. Before 1.21.9,
 * we used the {@link org.spigotmc.event.player.PlayerSpawnLocationEvent}, which was called at the perfect spot.
 * As of 1.21.9, this event is now called during the configuration phase, without a player instance being available.<br/>
 * So, to still get the player instance in time, we will now pause processing packets after the configuration phase
 * ends and wait for the {@link PlayerJoinEvent}. When the {@link PlayerJoinEvent} gets called, we are able
 * to save the player instance and resume processing packets.<br/>
 * This is not a great solution, but I don't think there is a better one at the moment.
